# Contributing to Demonology

Demonology is a a personal project and I work on it on my spare time. I am not willing nor able to dedicate much time on the project. I will not implement and maintain complex features if I'm not going to use them myself or if I think they are out of scope for the project.

With that in mind, I will gladly accept bug reports, feature requests, pull requests and other contributions. I will also respectfully decline contributions I cannot or do not want to handle for the reasons stated above.

This Code of Conduct is non-negotiable and I will gladly enforce it. You can also contact me at demonology@agate.blue if you think some moderation action needs to be taken.
